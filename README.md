# BUY ME A COFFEE

## How to use it

Connect your wallet on the Goerli testnet, write your name/pseudo and a small text if you want. Then choose how much you want to give:

- Small coffee at 0.001ETH
- Medium coffee at 0.003ETH
- Coffee pot at 0.005ETH

When you will click on of the button you will be able to confirm the transaction and the coffee will be send. After few seconds you will be able to see your message on the Memos received ! 

## A bit of background

This site was made as part of the roadtoweb3 programme created by alchemy.

The goal of this week was to create a buy me a coffee page and the smart contract for this.

## What technologies I used ?

For this project, I used [Nextjs](http://nextjs.com), as well as [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styling but also [alchemy](http://alchemy.com/nft-api) API to deploy my smart contract on the goerli testnet. 

The site was finished and deployed thanks to [Vercel](http://vercel.com). You can access it here: [https://buymeacafe.vercel.app](https://buymeacafe.vercel.app)

## Difficulties

The biggest difficulty was dealing with the memo received part I had some difficulties to show it how I want. But I did it!

The footer wasnâ€™t really cooperative. At first he was taking half of the page but I finally found a workaround and it works great.

 The styling with tailwind, I had some difficulty making it work but their documentation is rich and very nice to read.
